### Markdown
Pappel utilizes the power of markdown in order to allow for fast and easy text formatting. This is made possible using Markdown4J, which supports the standard markdown formatting as well as extra addon based additions, which can be found [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/markdown4j/).

If you are not familiar with markdown you can learn [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

### Getting familiar with the user interface 

Pappel is easy to navigate around and only has a few buttons to focus on 
simplicity and productivity. 

###The Preview Button

In order to conserve space on lower resolution screens, Pappel features a preview button to toggle between markdown and its final result. 

###The Export Button 

Exporting in Pappel has been made convenient and a click away. Simply select the preview button and select one of the available exporting features. **Note**: If you have trouble using one of the exporting features, make sure that you have successfully installed all of the dependencies.

###The Delete Button

Deleting a note is simple! Just select the delete button and don't worry, you will be asked twice to make sure that is what you really want. 

###The Distraction Free Button

Probably on of Pappel's coolest features, the distraction free button allows you to fully emerge in your content without the distraction of other things in your view. You will be emerged in your content and nothing else. To exit this mode simply either hit the escape key or click on the selection free button again.

###The Settings Button

In Pappel's settings you will find the following features

- Appearance - Chose on of the available themes to make Pappel your own

- General - Find the General settings for Pappel

###The Add Buttons

Within the columns for your displayed saved notes, you can use the add buttons to wither add a new note or notebook

###Creating Content

To create your note - simply give your note a tile where the word "Tile" appears and your content where the phrase "Let's create something!" appears - and dont worry about saving your content - Pappel takes care of this for you.

###The Action Bar

Productivity at it's best; the action bar allows for users to focus more on their content and less on what they have to do to achieve this content by giving users the ability to write away without
restraining from their keyboards with the concept of commands. To display the action bar simply hit the F2 button on your keyboard. You can find Pappel's action bar commands bellow:

usage : command [arguments]
example: web-search: What is Pappel? 

- web-search: - search the web using google's search engine for anything you want
- web-address: - go to a web page 
- add-image: - add images to your document (image can include a url or locally hosted file)
- add-note: - add a new note (argument should be the desired note name) 
- add-notebook: - add  anew notebook (argument should be the desired notebook name)

###The Web Action Window 

The web action window interfaces with Pappel to allow easy pinning of content to your note. This window will appear when using its corresponding commands such as 'web-search:' or 'web-address:' To pin content, simply click on the pin button that looks like a paper clip on the top right of the web action window and the content that is currently on your skin will attach to your note as a link.
